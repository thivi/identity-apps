## Export user profile

Using the **export user profile** feature in **My Account**, a JSON file can be downloaded. This file includes the user's personal information, consents, and other claims allowing the user to extract the information that is being is recorded about them in WSO2 IS.

```tip
The consent receipts in the
`           userInfo.json          ` file contain the PII controller information
as it is, at the time that the receipt is generated. If the PII controller has
changed after the receipt was generated, this change will not be reflected in the
existing receipts. To get an updated consent receipt that reflects the change,
generate a new consent receipt by doing one of the following:

1.  Revoke the consent via **My Account** and go through the flow that prompts
    the relevant consent again (i.e., revoke the given consent for an application
    in WSO2 IS, log out, then log back in. Now approve the consent again. A new consent
    receipt will be generated for that application consent).

2.  Use the [Consent Management REST APIs](../../develop/using-the-consent-management-rest-apis) to revoke the
    existing consent and add a new consent.
```
You can export your profile by following the instructions given below.

1. [Access **My Account**](#access-my-account-and-its-components).
2. Click the **Personal info** tab on the side panel.
3. Under the **Export profile** sub section, click on the **Download as JSON** button. All the profile details will be downloaded to your local machine as a JSON file.

## Multi-factor authentication

MFA creates a layered defense and makes it more difficult for an unauthorized person to access a target such as a physical location, computing device, web service, network, or database. If one factor is compromised or broken, the attacker still has at least one more barrier to breach before successfully breaking into the target. WSO2 Identity Server allows configuring multi-step authentication where you can define an authentication chain containing different authenticators in different steps. For more information on MFA, see [Multi-factor Authentication](../../learn/multi-factor-authentication).

Using the latest **My Account** application, users can update their mobile numbers through which they can authenticate themselves using the one-time verification code. Also, they can add inherence factors like FIDO devices and fingerprint sensors. The following section will provide instructions on how to configure MFA options in WSO2 IS using **My Account**.

### Via SMS

1. [Access **My Account**](#access-my-account-and-its-components).
2. Click the **Security** tab on the side panel.
3. Under the **Multi-factor authentication** section, click on the edit icon aligning with the **via SMS** section.
4. Enter the mobile number that needs to be added as the MFA factor and click **update**.

```info
This will also update the mobile number in the user profile.
```

### Via security device

```info
This is supported by only a few browsers namely Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
```

#### Add security device

1. [Access **My Account**](#access-my-account-and-its-components).
2. Click the **Security** tab on the side panel.
3. Under the **Multi-factor authentication** section, click on the add icon aligning with the **via security device** section.
4. Select an option depending on whether to add a USB security key or a built-in sensor.

7. Add the preferred device name.

    ![fido-option-device-name](/myaccount/resources/i18n/assets/myaccount/account-recovery/fido-option-device-name.png)

8. Once the device is successfully added, the registered device will be listed along with its name.

    ![fido-devices-list](/myaccount/resources/i18n/assets/myaccount/account-recovery/fido-devices-list.png)

```info
* Using an older FIDO device *

If an older FIDO device is used when registering the device, an error message mentioning that the device cannot be used will be displayed.
This means the device is not capable of performing [passwordless authentication](../learn/passwordless-authentication-using-fido2.md) and can only be used as a [second factor](../learn/multi-factor-authentication-using-fido.md). The device will have to be added as an **"Older Device"**.

Follow the steps given below to add the device as an older device.

1. Click **close**.

    ![fido-device-old](/myaccount/resources/i18n/assets/myaccount/account-recovery/fido-device-old.png)


2. Click **Try with an older Device**.

    ![fido-device-old-error](/myaccount/resources/i18n/assets/myaccount/account-recovery/fido-device-old-error.png)


3. From this point onwards, the steps to register the device are the same as the steps given in [Add security device](#add-security-device).
```

#### Delete security device

Any security device registered under MFA can be simply removed by clicking the delete icon.

## Monitor active user sessions

The **Active user sessions** section in **My Account** enables users to view details related to the sessions of the different applications that are accessed via WSO2 IS. When the **show more** button aligning with a specific session is clicked, it will display a detailed view of the session including the operating system, ip address, applications list, login time, and the last accessed time.

Depending on the user’s preference, **My Account** allows the users either to terminate all the sessions at once or terminate sessions one by one. By clicking the **terminate all** button at the top right corner, users can terminate all the active sessions with a single button click. If they wish to terminate a specific session, they can click on **terminate session** in the **detailed view** section.

## Consent management

WSO2 IS provides a comprehensive consent management solution that can be used to manage consents related to Identity and Access Management (IAM), and also to manage consents that belong to third party applications. For more information, see [Consent Management](../../learn/consent-management).

## Review pending approvals

WSO2 IS enables more control over the tasks that are executed using workflows. This is particularly useful in a scenario where user accounts need to be approved in WSO2 IS. Workflows provide the flexibility to configure this approval process in a way that suits the user's scenario.

**My Account** allows you to review the workflow operations like adding users, updating user claims, deleting users, and approving or denying them. For the convenience of the users, pending approvals are categorized into three states namely, **ready, reserved and completed**.

Whenever a user gets created in the system, that task will appear under the **ready** section waiting for approval. Whenever a task  is reviewed and claimed, that task will be listed under the **reserved** section of approvals. Once the task is approved or denied, it will appear under the **completed** section.
